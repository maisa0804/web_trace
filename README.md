This project is a clone of a modern landing page designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to practice layout techniques and JavaScript interactions.

- Responsive design
- Modern LP sote design

## Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- HTML Template Tag: This project uses the `<template>` element to define reusable components, which are injected into the DOM via JavaScript to keep the code modular and concise.

## Optimizations
To avoid long and repetitive code, I used the `<template>` tag to define reusable HTML structures. This allows for a clean separation of concerns and reduces redundancy, making the code easier to maintain.
